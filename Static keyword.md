When we define a variable or properties using static keyword, it can share the values among all the instance or object of a class. 
By adding the Static keyword to an objectâ€™s properties and methods we can use them without the need of creating an instance first. 
(note that both variables and constants can be static as well.)

class AA{
    static var count = 0
    
    init() {
        AA.count += 1
    }
    
    static func add(){
        print("Do somethings..")
    }
}
